Q1:

Client Initialization:
    The client initiates the communication process by creating a socket.A socket is a software abstraction representing an endpoint for communication. The client's socket will be used to connect to the server.

Server Initialization:
    Similarly, the server initializes by creating a socket and binding it to a specific port on the host machine. This allows the server to listen for incoming connection requests.

Connection Request:
    The client sends a connection request to the server. This is typically done by specifying the server's IP address and port number to establish a connection.

Server Acceptance:
    The server receives the connection request from the client and accepts it. Upon accepting the request, the server creates a new socket dedicated to handling communication with this particular client.

Handshake:
    Once the connection is established, a handshake process may occur. This involves an exchange of control messages between the client and the server to ensure both parties are ready to communicate and agree on communication parameters such as the protocol to be used, encryption methods, or other relevant settings.

Data Transfer:
    After the connection is successfully established and any necessary handshakes are completed, data transfer can occur bidirectionally. Both the client and server can send and receive data over the established connection. This data can include requests, responses, or any other information relevant to the application being used.

Connection Termination:
    Once the communication is complete, either the client or the server can initiate the termination of the connection. This is typically done by sending a specific message indicating the intent to close the connection. Upon receiving this message, both parties perform any necessary cleanup actions and close their respective sockets, releasing the allocated resources.






Q2:
    In socket programming, the bind() method connects a socket to a given network address, such as an IP address or port number. Servers often use this function to provide the IP to listen for incoming connections.



Q3:
    A datagram socket is a network socket that allows communication between machines on a network. This is a key topic in network programming, especially for protocols such as UDP.
