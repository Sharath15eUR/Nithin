                Process	                                    Thread
Definition	    A process is an independent unit of         A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process, 
                execution, consisting of its own memory     sharing the same memory space and resources.
                space, resources, and state.	

Creation	    Processes are created using system          Threads are created within a process using threading libraries    
                calls like fork() or exec().	            like pthreads or Win32 threads.

Overhead	    Processes have higher overhead due          Threads have lower overhead since they share memory and 
                to separate memory space and resource       resources within the same process
                allocation.	

Communication	Inter-process communication (IPC)           Threads within the same process can communicate directly 
                mechanisms like pipes, sockets, or          through shared variables or synchronized mechanisms 
                shared memory are used for communication    like mutexes and condition variables.
                between processes.                         

Concurrency	    Processes run concurrently and              Threads within the same process run concurrently and share resources,
                independently of each other.	            allowing for parallel execution.

Context Switch	Context switching between processes         Context switching between threads within the same process is faster  
                involves higher overhead due to switching   since they share the same memory space and resources.
                memory spaces and resources.	

Stability	    Processes are more stable and less prone    Threads are less stable, as a crash in one thread can potentially 
                to crashing, as failure in one Process      affect other threads within the same process.
                typically does not affect others. 	

Scalability	    Scaling processes can be more challenging   Threads are more scalable since they can be created and  
                due to the overhead associated with         managed more efficiently within the same process.
                creating and managing separate memory 
                spaces.
